# Maintainer, Heal Thyself
Henry Zhu

## Difficulties
- people make lots of assumptions
- we're always on call
- high expectations for maintainers
- people frustrated when mistakes happen
- silence is the norm, people only speak up when there's a problem
- saying no is temporary, yes is forever

## Solutions
- human deprecation messages
- how to handle entitlement
- take care of yourself before you take care of others
- open source is free and unpaid
- appreciate the mundane <3
- spread around the work

## Culture
- people relate more to your weaknesses than your strengths
- don't be hostile back
- focus on the community, not just the code
- hard to get positive feedback
- Github open source fridays (we should do this)
- Be a positive example
